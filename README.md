### Currently

I am currently a fellow at [Formation](https://formation.dev/) and I am an alum of [Turing School of Software & Design.](https://turing.edu/) who studied backend engineering. 
### Iâ€™m currently learning

Python, Bash scripting, AWS, Ruby, Rails, RESTful APIs, and have touched on many other frameworks, tools, and languages during my time at Turing and Formation.

I am currently a DevOps Engineer at [Centil](https://www.centil.io/) but looking to transition to a full stack or back end engineering position.
